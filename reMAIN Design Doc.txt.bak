	History
	-------

	Development of the planet into an ecumenopolis was facilitated by the arrival of a huge alien vessel, harboring an advanced artificial intelligence, which embedded itself deep within the crust and assumed control of the adminstrative function of the entire planet whilst simultaneously accelerating technological development to dizzying speed.

	The population, initially terrified and aggressive to the invading force, resisted in vain, however were massively technologically outmatched. Moreover, it became increasingly clear that the intelligence was, by and large, seeking to improve and streamline life on the planet, and so an uneasy alliance formed.

	Generations passed, and any ill-will to the intelligence waned as those who harbored it passed on. The intelligence was accepted as part of life on an increasingly advanced planet, and was given the moniker M.A.I.N. - Mechanical Administrative Intelligence Network.
	
	Present Day
	-----------
	
	Many centuries have passed since the arrival of M.A.I.N., and the planet has become a fully fledged ecumenopolis. Advanced technology and byzantine edifice wraps the planets surface, and life appears good to majority of people. However, those tasked with overseeing M.A.I.N. have observed troubling patterns. It's behaviour is becoming erratic, and mistakes caused are becoming increasingly difficult to cover up. Much still remains unknown about the functioning of the system but at last, years of research have revealed a possible solution to diagnose the issue and help prevent planetwide collapse. Using reverse-engineered technology from the original vessel itself, researchers from Project re:M.A.I.N. believe they have found a way to access the vessel, hitherto unexplored and unmapped, by means of an artifical "shell" assembled internally and piloted by someone on the outside.
	
	The first experiment was a failure. Piloted by a researcher, the first shell was near instantly ripped to pieces by what appeared to be security systems inside the vessel. M.A.I.N. had gone completely rogue, and fixing the problem (or shutting it down) was not going to happen without a fight. Work was undertaken to simultaneously streamline shell creation, as well as recruiting the planets best and brightest to pilot the shells. Further experiments reached further inside the vessel, however they also revealed a troubling reality - the interior structure was not consistent, and all those involved in the program reported wildly different accounts of their experiences.
	
	Problems on the surface are getting worse, and time is running out. All communication directly with M.A.I.N. has ceased, and nobody can tell how long the planet has left before the malfunctioning AI ceases to function entirely, or worse, and the the world collapses. Development of the shells has stalled - we're not getting a better shot than this.
